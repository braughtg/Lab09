These projections are based on computer simulations of [climate models](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/climate-models).  In this lab, you will learn about climate models and experiment with one such model [SimMod](http://berkeleyearth.org/simmod-a-simple-python-based-climate-model/).  SimMod is a \"simple python based climate model\" created by Zeke Hausfather with the [Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/) project.
