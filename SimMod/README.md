# SimMod - Python Simple Climate Model
Version 0.3 (Alpha - may contain bugs!)
![SimMod vs. CMIP5](https://s22.postimg.cc/3rcbpfvoh/simmod_cmip5_temperature_comparison_python.png)

## Usage
0. Make sure you have numpy and pandas installed.
1. Open simmod_controller.py in your editing tool of choice
2. Select desired parameters for RCP, carbon model, climate sensitivity, etc.
3. Run simmod_controller.py in your terminal via python simmod_controller.py
4. Results will be saved as a csv in the SimMod/results folder.

## Notes
The heat diffusion module that converts radiative forcing to global mean
surface temperatures currently breaks for timesteps other than 1 year.
This will be fixed in the near future.

The BEAM carbon model overestimates 2100 atmospheric CO2 concentrations
by ~25% relative to RCP scenarios. Using the pulse response carbon model
is recommended for the time being.

The latest BEAM model can be found here: https://github.com/RDCEP/BEAM-carbon/find/master
